ZenPack to overcome issues with Administered Objects code in Core

Please see the comments at the start of __init__.py for most of the detail of what this
ZenPack does.  

__init__.py has most of the code.

There are some skins files to implement an extra Role menu but this functionality is
currently commented out.

configure.zcml wires-in the Role menu.

objects/objects.xml defines 2 new dropdown menus for the Roles menus.

The lib directory has the copyDashboardState.py utility to copy the dashboard
configuration of one user, to another user.

This ZenPack has been tested with a user that has the ZenCommon global role.  They are
added to a group which has Administered Objects configured with the
ZenOperator role.  The result is that the user ONLY sees those devices and
Organizers for which Administered Objects are configured.  The user can Ack
and Close events from those devices.  By default, you get to see the usual
View stuff for such devices but you will NOT see any graphs (for the
device or its components).  

Graphs are deliverd by the RenderServer in $ZENHOME/Products/ZenRRD/RenderServer.py.  
Although the user's role is augmented by the Administered Object, this is only for a 
device and the RenderService is not of class Device - hence no role applies 
(and View is required).  This is fixed by the allowAuthenticatedRender method which
sets a ZEN_VIEW permission for the instance of class RenderServer, for any
authenticated user.

For the GoogleMaps portlet to work for restricted users, permissions need changing
for GoogleMapsPortlet from ZEN_VIEW toZEN_COMMON in 
$ZENHOME/Products/ZenWidgets/ZenossPortlets/ZenossPortlets.py. This is done in the
updatePortletPermissions method.  Note that new permissions need registering, not
just changing. 

Also for GoogleMaps, methods for the Location class (which currently have no 
security tags so default to View), need to have a security tag for ZEN_COMMON.  
(You can add security tags in a ZenPack but you cannot override any that exist in Core code).


Tests done on Zenoss 3.1 under Open SuSE 11.4
